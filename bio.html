              Born in New Mexico, Richard Martinez commenced his college studies at Princeton University, graduating with an A.B. in Architecture. He earned his Master of Architecture from Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture and Planning. In 1992, he established Martinez Architecture Studio in Santa Fe, which specializes in both residential and commercial architectural services. He has designed over 260 residences and commercial buildings, including the renovation of the historic St. Francis Hotel, which garnered him the 2011 Best Building Award. He has been recognized by the State of New Mexico as well as the City of Santa Fe for numerous Heritage Preservation Awards for his designs, most recently in May 2015 for 777 Acequia Madre. Richard is an active member of the Santa Fe community, serving as a Board Member of the Historic Santa Fe Foundation, and the SouthWest Care Center. His free time is spent restoring his great-grandfather&#39s stone and adobe home.</p>
